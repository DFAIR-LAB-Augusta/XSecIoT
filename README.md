# 🔥 XSecIoT: Explainable ML for IoT Security

XSecIoT is a research project that implements a machine learning-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for IoT networks. It listens to **real-time network flow data** generated by `cicflowmeter` and classifies flows as **benign or malicious**. To enhance model transparency, **XAI (Explainable AI)** techniques like **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** are integrated for **PCA-based feature importance analysis**.

## 📁 Repository Structure
This repository is divided into two main directories:

1. **`fire_notebooks/`** – Contains Jupyter notebooks from the original **FIRE** (Flow-based IoT Risk Evaluator) ML implementation.
2. **`xseciot_core/`** – The standalone Python implementation, along with a Bash script to:
   - Run **cicflowmeter** for real-time flow capture.
   - Start the **Python listener & ML classifier**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test FIRE
```bash
python3 -m FIRE_codebase.main ./datasets/DFAIR/combined_data_with_okpVacc_modified.csv > test.txt 2>&1
```

### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2️⃣ Run XSecIoT**
Start `cicflowmeter` and the ML listener with:

```bash
bash run_xseciot.sh
```

This will:
- Start `cicflowmeter` to capture live network flows.
- Launch the Python-based **ML classifier**, which listens on `http://127.0.0.1:2048` for incoming flows.
- Perform real-time **classification** and **explainability analysis**.

## 🔬 Machine Learning Model
The ML component of XSecIoT is designed to:
✅ Process **live network flows** from `cicflowmeter`.  
✅ Extract flow-based features for classification.  
✅ Classify each flow as **benign** or **malicious**.  
✅ Provide **explanations** for predictions using **SHAP feature importance analysis**.

## 📊 Explainable AI (XAI) in XSecIoT
XSecIoT integrates **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) to:
- **Analyze feature importance** in the PCA-transformed feature space.
- **Provide transparency** into model decisions.
- **Improve trust** in ML-based IoT security.
